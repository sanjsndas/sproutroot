They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, provide features, and collect information about how visitors use sites. Cookies typically don't contain personally identifiable information but may be used in combination with other data to recognize you. There are several types of cookies, including session cookies that expire when you close your browser and persistent cookies that remain until deleted or expired.</p>

First-party cookies are primarily for essential functions and analytics. Third-party cookies include services like Google Analytics for website statistics, social media cookies for sharing content, and advertising cookies for targeted marketing.

They are typically set in response to actions you take, such as setting your privacy preferences or filling in forms.

They allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve site performance. These cookies help us know which pages are most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. The information these cookies collect is aggregated and anonymous, not used to identify you personally. We use services like Google Analytics for this purpose.</p>

They work by uniquely identifying your browser and internet device to show you relevant advertisements on other sites. These cookies are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you don't allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.

Social media cookies enable you to share content from our site through platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Advertising networks may set cookies to deliver relevant ads to you.

                    <p class="text-gray-700">Cookies can remain on your device for different periods of time. Session cookies are temporary and expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your device for the period specified in the cookie or until you manually delete them. Some cookies expire after a few hours or days, while others may last for several years. The duration depends on the purpose of the cookie and the technology used to implement it.

Our cookie consent tool allows users to choose which categories of cookies to accept. We maintain records of consent and make it easy for users to change their preferences.

When we detect a DNT signal, we disable all non-essential cookies and tracking technologies by default. However, some features may not work properly without certain cookies.
